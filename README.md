# Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a research project that explores the causal effects of sleep quality on stress levels. The analysis includes a covariate analysis based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and utilizes propensity score matching to assess the causal relationship between sleep quality and stress levels.

# Course Project Information

This research project was conducted as part of the coursework for the "Computational Methods of Economics" course. The project aimed to apply computational and statistical methods to analyze a causal research question.

# Key Components
## 1. Covariate Analysis

A covariate analysis has been performed based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to identify and account for potential confounding variables in the relationship between sleep quality and stress levels.

## 2. Propensity Score Matching

Propensity score matching has been employed to estimate the causal effects of sleep quality on stress levels. This method helps control for observed confounding variables and improve the causal inference process.

## 3. t.tests on matched data
